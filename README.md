# MERN E-Commerce Multi-Vendor Application

This project utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to develop a multi-vendor e-commerce platform. It delivers a seamless and unified customer experience while catering to the needs of third-party sellers. MongoDB handles the database, Express.js creates a robust API, React.js provides an interactive user interface, and Node.js manages server-side operations.
